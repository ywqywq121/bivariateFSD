# A consistent semi-parametric test for bivariate stochastic dominance

This repository contains R programs for the article “A consistent semi-parametric test for bivariate stochastic dominance.”
<!-- This article has been submitted for publication. -->
## Part 1. Reproducing simulation results in Section 5.1 of the manuscript
This part compares three methods for estimating the bivariate distribution function: the empirical estimator, kernel density estimator, and our semiparametric estimator introduced in Section 2.2 of the manuscript. The ```R``` codes to reproduce the results are attached: [Estimation_coparision.R](https://github.com/ywqywq121/bivariateFSD/blob/master/Estimation_coparision.R).
